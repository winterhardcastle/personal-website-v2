# personal-website-v2

A different take on my portfolio website, using similar themes and techniques as original portfolio.

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio that conveys my broad experience in Software, Design and Making.

I enjoy using interfaces that manage to be interesting and dymanic despite their simplicity. This website is intended to be an example of this!

<h2> Notes </h2>
- 3D elements and use react-three-drei and react-three-fiber instead of vanilla three.js <br />
- Contact form data is handled with EmailJS. <br />
- Hackertext animation inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/W5oawMJaXbU">Hyperplexed</a>, ported to be a standalone function for ez use in tailwind<br />
- All 3D models are designed by me. <br />
